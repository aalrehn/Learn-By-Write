# List
 In your programs, you often need to group several elements in order to process them as a single object. For this, you will need to use different collections. One of the most useful collections in Python is a list. It is one of the most important things in Python.

## Creating and printing lists
Look at a simple list that stores several names of dogs' breeds:

```python
dog_breeds = ['corgi', 'labrador', 'poodle', 'jack russell']
print(dog_breeds)  # ['corgi', 'labrador', 'poodle', 'jack russell']
```
In the first line, we use square brackets to create a list that contains four elements and then assign it to the `dog_breeds` variable. In the second line, the list is printed through the variable's name. All the elements are printed in the same order as they were stored in the list because lists are **ordered**.

Here is another list that contains five integers:
