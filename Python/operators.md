# Integer arithmetic
 - In real life, we often perform arithmetic operations. They help us to calculate the change from a purchase, determine the area of a room, count the number of people in a line, and so on. The same operations are used in programs.

## Basic operations 
 #### Python supports basic arithmetic operations
 - addition +
 - subtraction -
 - multiplication *
 - division /
 - integer division //
 #### The examples below show how it works for numbers.

       print(10 + 10)   # 20
       print(100 - 10)  # 90
       print(10 * 10)   # 100
       print(77 / 10)   # 7.7
       print(77 // 10)  # 7
 #### There is a difference between division / and integer division //. The first produces a floating-point number (like 7.7), while the second one produces an integer value (like 7) ignoring the decimal part.
