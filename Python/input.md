# Taking input
 - Sometimes programs need to interact with users, either to receive some data or to deliver some sort of result. And that's when the input() function steals the show.

# Reading input from a user
 - The input data we want to get is nothing but some value entered by the user. 
 The input() function reads this value and returns it in a program as a string. For example, the following program reads the user name and prints a greeting


       user_name = input()
       print('Hello, ' + user_name)
