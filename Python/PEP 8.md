# PEP 8
 - How to write code that is clean and easy to read? That is the question that you bump into when moving from simple single-line programs to more 
complicated ones. In the beginning, it may seem unimportant, but in real life, programming is a process that involves a lot of people that work together, so you 
spend more time reading code than writing it.
 - Although Python is often more readable than other programming languages because of its minimalistic syntax, just syntax itself is not enough. 
It is the way you write code that affects general readability. That is why you need to follow common conventions about
programming style, so other programmers could read your code easily.
 - You may ask, where do these conventions come from? There is a document that is called PEP 8. The key idea of it is to use the same code
style for all python projects as if they were written by the same programmer. This document guarantees that even a beginner will easily understand the code, written
by any other developer.
