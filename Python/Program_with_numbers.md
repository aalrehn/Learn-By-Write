# Program with numbers
## Reading numbers from user input
 You  might have become familiar with the input() function in Python, it's hardly new to you that any data passed to this function is treated as a string. But how should we deal with numerical values? As a general rule, they are explicitly converted to corresponding numerical types:
       
     integer = int(input())
     floating_point = float(input())
