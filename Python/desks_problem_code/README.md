#  Desks ( USING PYTHON OPERATORS ONLY)
A school has decided to create three new math groups and equip three classrooms for them with new desks. At most two students may sit at any desk. The number of students in each of the three groups is known. Output the smallest number of desks to be purchased.

Each group will sit in its own classroom.

Input data format:

The program receives the input of three non-negative integers: the number of students in each of the three classes (the numbers do not exceed 1000).

HINT : You should find the number of desks in each classroom independently and then sum the three numbers to get the total one.
