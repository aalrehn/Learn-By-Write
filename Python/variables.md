# Variables
 - You can use a programming language like Python to do calculations or to work with constant values like strings. Is it enough for you, though? When
 writing real programs, you usually need to store values or evaluation results in computer memory.
## What is a variable?
 - Variable is a named place where you can store some value and access the value later. Imagine a box where you keep something. That's a variable.

 - For example, you calculate something and would like to reuse the formula for some other numbers. In this case, you operate only these "boxes".
 - In general, it's a good practice to give a variable a name that describes its content.
## Defining a variable and assigning values
 - You can keep almost anything in variables just assigning the new value for a 
  named variable with an equal sign. Also, following PEP 8, one space before and after the assignment sign is considered good practice.
