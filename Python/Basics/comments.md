# What is a comment?
 - Sometimes you need to explain what some particular parts of your code are for. Lucky you, since Python gives you an 
 opportunity to fulfill your needs. You can leave special notes called comments.
 - Python comments start with a hash #. Everything after the hash mark and up to the end of the line is regarded as a comment and will be ignored when running the code.


    
    
       print("This will run.")  # This won't run
