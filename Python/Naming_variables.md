## Naming variables
 - As you know, every variable has a name that uniquely identifies it among other variables. Giving a good name to 
 a variable may not be as simple as it seems. Experienced programmers are careful when naming their variables to ensure that their programs are easy to
 understand. It is important because programmers spend a lot of time reading and understanding code written by other programmers. If variables have bad names, even your own code 
 will seem unclear to you in a few months.
 ## Code style convention
  PEP 8 provides some rules for variable names to increase code readability.
 - #### Use lowercase and underscores to split words. Even if it's an abbreviation
     
     http_response  # yes!
     httpresponse   # no
     myVariable     # no, that's from Java
